# Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic

Project 2 of the Nand to Tetris course focuses on building an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) capable of performing various arithmetic and logical operations on 16-bit inputs. This project builds upon the logic gates implemented in Project 1 to create a fully functional ALU.

## Summary

- **Half Adder:** A basic building block for addition, adding two single bits.

- **Full Adder:** Builds on the Half Adder to add two bits along with a carry-in bit, producing a sum and a carry-out bit.

- **Adder:** Combines multiple Full Adders to add two 16-bit numbers.

- **Incrementer:** Adds 1 to a 16-bit input, effectively incrementing the number by 1.

- **ALU:** Combines the Adder, Incrementer, and logic gates to create a 16-bit ALU capable of performing addition, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and more.
