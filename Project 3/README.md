# Project 3: Sequential Logic

Part 3 of the Nand to Tetris course focuses on implementing sequential logic using flip-flops to build registers, memory units, and a 16-bit CPU. This part builds upon the previous 2 projects.

## Summary

- **Bit**: Represents a single bit, the smallest unit of information in a computer. It can store either a 0 or a 1.
  
- **PC**: Stands for Program Counter. It is a register in a computer processor that stores the address of the next instruction to be executed.

- **Register**: Represents a register that can store a 16-bit value. It is used for temporary storage of data within the CPU.

- **RAM4K**: Represents a RAM unit with a capacity of 4,096 16-bit words. It is a smaller version of RAM16K.
  
- **RAM8**: Represents a RAM unit with a capacity of 8 16-bit words. It is the smallest RAM unit among the ones listed.
  
- **RAM16K**: Represents a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit with a capacity of 16,384 16-bit words. It can be used to store data and instructions temporarily for the CPU to access.
  
- **RAM64**: Represents a RAM unit with a capacity of 64 16-bit words. It is smaller than RAM512.
  
- **RAM512**: Represents a RAM unit with a capacity of 512 16-bit words. It is smaller than RAM4K.
