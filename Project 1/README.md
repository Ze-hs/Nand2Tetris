# Project 1: Boolean Logic

<p>Project 1 focuses on the construction of basic logic gates using a Hardware Description Language (HDL). This project aims to develop a foundational understanding of digital logic design by building from the most basic gate, the NAND gate, to more complex gates such as Multiplexers. </p>


## Gates Implemented

- **Not Gate:** Outputs the negation of its input.
  
- **And Gate:** Outputs true only if all its inputs are true.

- **Or Gate:** Outputs true if any of its inputs are true.

- **Xor Gate:** Outputs true if exactly one of its inputs is true.

- **Mux Gate:** Selects one of its inputs based on a control signal.

- **DMux Gate:** Routes a single input to one of multiple outputs based on a control signal.

- **Not16 Gate:** Produces the bitwise negation of a 16-bit input.

- **And16 Gate:** Produces the bitwise AND of two 16-bit inputs.

- **Or16 Gate:** Produces the bitwise OR of two 16-bit inputs.

- **Mux16 Gate:** Selects one of two 16-bit inputs based on a control signal.

- **Or8Way Gate:** Computes the bitwise OR of eight 1-bit inputs.

- **Mux4Way16 Gate:** Selects one of four 16-bit inputs based on a control signal.

- **Mux8Way16 Gate:** Selects one of eight 16-bit inputs based on a control signal.

- **DMux4Way Gate:** Routes a single input to one of four outputs based on a control signal.

- **DMux8Way Gate:** Routes a single input to one of eight outputs based on a control signal.
