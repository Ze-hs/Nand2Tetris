# Project 5: Computer Architecture

Project 5 of the Nand to Tetris course focuses on designing and implementing a computer architecture that includes a Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output (I/O) devices. This project builds upon the previous projects by integrating the hardware components created in the previous projects

## Summary

- **CPU:** The Central Processing Unit that executes instructions and performs calculations.
  
- **Memory:** Components to store data and instructions for the CPU, including RAM (Random Access Memory)
  
- **Computer:** The complete computer system, including the CPU, memory and ROM.
