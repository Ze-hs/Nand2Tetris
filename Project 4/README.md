# Project 4: Machine Language

Project 4 of the Nand to Tetris course focuses on writing programs in machine language and developing an assembler to translate assembly code into machine code. This project bridges the gap between the hardware components built in the previous projects and the software that runs on them.

## Summary 
Write and test the following two assembly programs:

- **Mult.asm:** Computes the product of 2 non-negative numbers stored in R[0] and R[1] and store it in R[2]
  
- **Fill.asm:** Monitor the keyboard for any key presses and fill the screen with black pixels when detected. Otherwise clear the screen when any key is released.
